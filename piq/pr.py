    r"""
    Interface of Improved Precision and Recall.
    It's computed for a whole set of data and uses features from encoder instead of images itself to decrease
    computation cost. Precision and Recall can compare two data distributions with different number of samples.
    But dimensionalities should match, otherwise it won't be possible to correctly compute statistics.

    Args:
        real_features: Samples from data distribution. Shape :math:`(N_x, D)`
        fake_features: Samples from generated distribution. Shape :math:`(N_y, D)`

    Returns:
        precision: Scalar value of the precision of image sets features.
        recall: Scalar value of the recall of image sets features.
